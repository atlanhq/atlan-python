# Atlan Python SDK

This repository houses the code for a Python SDK to interact with [Atlan](https://atlan.com).

## [Documentation](https://developer.atlan.com/getting-started/python-sdk/)

[https://developer.atlan.com/getting-started/python-sdk/](https://developer.atlan.com/getting-started/python-sdk/)



## Installing for Development

### Initial Setup
To get started developing the SDK:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed. You can verify your Python version with:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

3. Set up a virtual environment for development:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Code Formatting
Before committing code, ensure it adheres to the repository's formatting guidelines. You can apply the required formatting using the below command:

```bash
./pyatlan-formatter
```

### Environment Setup
For running integration tests, you'll need to configure your environment:

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Update the `.env` file with your Atlan API key and base URL.
3. Load the environment variables:
    - For macOS/Linux:
      ```bash
      export $(cat .env | xargs)
      ```
    - For Windows (PowerShell):
      ```powershell
      Get-Content .env | ForEach-Object {
          if ($_ -match '^(.*?)=(.*)$') {
              $env:($matches[1]) = $matches[2]
          }
      }
      ```

## Testing the SDK

### Run all the QA checks
You can run all the QA checks using the following command:

```bash
./qa-checks
```

### Running Unit Tests
You can run the SDK's unit tests **without needing access to an Atlan environment**:

```bash
pytest tests/unit
```

### Running Integration Tests
Once the environment is set up, you can run integration tests:

- All integration tests:
  ```bash
  pytest tests/integration
  ```
- Specific integration tests:
  ```bash
  pytest tests/integration/<test_specific_feature>.py
  ```
